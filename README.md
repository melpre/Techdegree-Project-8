 My 8th Project: SQL Library Manager

This is a project example of a CRUD (create, read, update and delete) web application that manages a collection of library books. It utlizes JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the ORM Sequelize. This application was created for the purpose of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database tools to view and interact with a SQLite database.

To use, download project dependencies first via npm install on your terminal, then load the application with npm start.
